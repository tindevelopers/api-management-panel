```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_ANON_KEY_HERE
```

## 📋 Remaining Files with Project References

The following files still contain the project ID `kgaovsovhggehkpntbzu` but in **safe contexts** (documentation/guides):

- `MANUAL-SCHEMA-SETUP.md` - Database connection examples
- `USERS-SYSTEM-FIXES-COMPLETE.md` - Historical reference
- `ESLINT-FIX-SUMMARY.md` - Status documentation
- `SUPABASE-CLI-SETUP-COMPLETE.md` - Setup guide
- Various other documentation files

**Note**: These references are in documentation context and don't expose actual credentials.

## 🔐 Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Rotate Credentials (CRITICAL)
Since the credentials were exposed in git history, you should rotate them:

#### Rotate Supabase Anon Key:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kgaovsovhggehkpntbzu/settings/api
2. Click "Reset" on the anon/public key
3. Update the new key in:
   - Vercel environment variables
   - Local `.env.local` file
   - GitHub Secrets (if used)

#### Consider Creating New Supabase Project:
If the exposed credentials are critical, consider:
1. Creating a new Supabase project
2. Migrating your database schema
3. Updating all environment variables

### 2. Update Environment Variables
After rotating credentials, update them in:
- ✅ Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
- ✅ Local `.env.local` file
- ✅ GitHub Secrets (if using GitHub Actions)

### 3. Review Git History
The exposed credentials are still in git history. Consider:
- Using `git filter-branch` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner` to remove from history
- Or simply rotate the credentials (recommended approach)
